            Creates a virtual element that is visible on the elements trace when the layout overflow exception is thrown.
            This can be used to easily identify elements inside the elements trace tree and faster find issue root cause.

            Letter spacing controls space between characters. Value 0 corresponds to normal spacing defined by a font.
            Positive values create additional space, whereas negative values reduce space between characters.
            Added / reduced space is relative to the font size.

        <member name="P:QuestPDF.Settings.DocumentLayoutExceptionThreshold">
            <summary>
            This value represents the maximum number of pages that the library produces.
            This is useful when layout constraints are too strong, e.g. one element does not fit in another.
            In such cases, the library would produce document of infinite length, consuming all available resources.
            To break the algorithm and save the environment, the library breaks the rendering process after reaching specified length of document.
            If your content requires generating longer documents, please assign the most reasonable value.

            <summary>
            This flag generates additional document elements to cache layout calculation results.
            In the vast majority of cases, this significantly improves performance, while slightly increasing memory consumption.

        <member name="P:QuestPDF.Settings.EnableDebugging">
            <summary>
            This flag generates additional document elements to improve layout debugging experience.
            When the DocumentLayoutException is thrown, the library is able to provide additional execution context.
            It includes layout calculation results and path to the problematic area.

            <remarks>By default, this flag is enabled only when the debugger IS attached.</remarks>

        <member name="P:QuestPDF.Settings.CheckIfAllTextGlyphsAreAvailable">
            <summary>
            This flag enables checking the font glyph availability.
            If your text contains glyphs that are not present in the specified font,
            1) when this flag is enabled: the DocumentDrawingException is thrown. OR 
            2) when this flag is disabled: placeholder characters are visible in the produced PDF file. 
            Enabling this flag may slightly decrease document generation performance.
            However, it provides hints that used fonts are not sufficient to produce correct results.
